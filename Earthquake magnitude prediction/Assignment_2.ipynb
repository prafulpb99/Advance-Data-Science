    "# Earthquake Magnitude Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will study the Earthqauke data set.The main agenda about this notebook is to take the relevant features to predict the magnitude of the earthquake.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will start with Exploratory Data Analysis where we do data cleaning, remove anamolies and null handling.After successfully completing we will understand the pattern by the help of visualization. We will then, check if all the assumptions are true before performing any analysis.Once the data preprocessing is done, we will generate models for Linear and Logistic regression. We will also consider multi-colinearity and interaction effects.Using Machine Learning techniques we will fine tune the results by using Ridge regression for linear models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manitude of the earthquake is likely to be dependent on type and depth of the event. Lets learn by generating linear and logistic models if the predictions are right.\n",

    "19. magNst -The total number of seismic stations used to calculate the magnitude for this earthquake.\n",
    "20. status- Indicates whether the event has been reviewed by a human.\n",
    "21. locationSource -The network that originally authored the reported location of this event\n",
    "22. magSource - Network that originally authored the reported magnitude for this event.\n",

    "## Explanations of the analysis and interpretations of figures and graphs:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement the following regressions:\n",
    "    \n",
    " 1. [Linear Regression](LinearRegression.ipynb)\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. [Logistic Regression](LogisticRegression.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We have identified the parameters having highest correlation with target 'latitude'\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using stepwise regression we got our best models as follows:\n",
    "For Linear Regression,  has the best R^2 value with least number of predictoes and hence this is the best fit model as it gives best prediction with least complexity.\n",
    "Hence , by backward elimination stepwise regression selection we get 21 significant parameters in order to predict the future price for this housing dataset. Different models were used to predict the accuracy and here we see that the R squared 0.963 which is almost equal to 1. Therefore, it is inferred that Model 7 is the suitable model for this dataset.\n",
    "3. Similarly, for Logistic Regression we have achived 81.1% accuracy . Therefore Model 1 is the best model for thos dataset.\n",
